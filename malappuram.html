                      Malappuram (also Malapuram)  is a city[7] in the Indian state of Kerala, spread over an area of 58.20 km2 (22.47 sq mi). The first municipality in the district formed in 1969, Malappuram serves as the administrative headquarters of Malappuram district. Divided into 40 electoral wards, the city has a population density of 1,742 per square kilometre (4,510 per square mile).

                      
                      
                      According to the 2011 census, Malappuram metropolitan area is the fourth urban agglomeration in Kerala and the 25th largest in India with a total population of 1.7 million.[8] It is the fastest growing city in the world with a 44.1% urban growth between 2015 and 2020 as per the survey conducted by Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) based on the urban area growth during January 2020.[9][10] Malappuram is situated 54 km southeast of Calicut and 90 km northwest of Palakkad.[11] It is the first Indian municipal body to provide free Wi-Fi connectivity to its entire residents.[12][13] Malappuram is also the first Indian municipal body to achieve the International Organization for Standardization certificate.[14] It is also the first complaint-free municipality in the state.[15]
                      Malappuram was a military headquarters from ancient times through the ancient history of the city is hardly seen recorded. However, there are some pre-historic relics, particularly Rock-cut caves found in some parts of the city like Oorakam, Melmuri, Ponmala, Vengara etc. manifesting the inhabitancy.[19] Locality named like Valiyangadi, Kootilangadi, Pallipuram etc. points to the Jain - Buddhist history of Malappuram. Notably, the 1500-year-old Jain Temple above 2000 ft sea level at Oorakam Hill of Malappuram undoubtedly proves the same.[20] During the Sangam period, Eranadan Malappuram was under the Chera Empire. Places like Pattar Kadav, Panakkad, etc. are possibly evolved out of Pattars and Panars having lived there. But no further details are available about the life and culture of the people either during the Sangam age or in the post-Sangam age.[21]

            <section>A famous Muslim Pilgrimage in the Malappuram district, Mamburam is a shrine dedicated to the dead bodies of some of the primary Thangals of Kerala. It was a title given to the Arabs from Yemen who scattered from there and migrated to Kerala. 

              They held great importance to the locals of Kerala and thus, had this shrine dedicated to them. A local festival held here during the time of Muharram is one of the primary attractions of this place.

          <section>The River of Bharata, also known as Nila, the Bharathapuzha River is a west-flowing river in the state of Kerala, and is the second longest river in the state. The river has been an integral part of life in the southern regions of Malabar. The name Nila has been given to the river to show the importance of it being more than just a river, as there are several mentions of the river in the ancient Hindu scriptures. 

            All along the river, there are about 11 dams made to use its waters for the purpose of irrigation. Culturally, the river has an importance in a number of parts of the state, like the famous Kerala Kalamandalam which is housed on the banks of the river.
