                      Thrissur , also known by its former name Trichur, is a city and the headquarters of the Thrissur district in Kerala, India. It is the third largest urban agglomeration in Kerala after Kochi and Calicut urban areas and the 21st largest in India. It is famous for the Thrissur Pooram festival.[3][4]

                        The city is built around a 65-acre (26 ha) hillock called the Thekkinkadu Maidanam which seats the Vadakkumnathan temple. It is located 304 kilometres (189 mi) towards north-west of the state capital city Trivandrum.

                        Thrissur was once the capital of the Kingdom of Cochin.
                        The name Thrissur  is a shortened form Tamil  literally translates to 'A Big City or Town with the three places of worship of the "Lord Shiva"'. The name owes itself to the most prominent feature of the city, that is the Vadakkumnathan Temple, which has Shiva as its presiding deity.[7] Alternately, Thri-Shiva-Perur ( Three-Shiva-Palace) means the place with three Shiva temples which are said to be – the Vadakkumnathan Temple, Kottapuram Shiva temple and the Poonkunnam Siva Temple.
                        
                        
                        Thrissur is known as "cultural capital of Kerala" because of its cultural, spiritual and religious leanings throughout history.[5] One of its main cultural events is the Thrissur Pooram, which attracts quite a number of tourists and travellers.[6]

          <img src="./images/thri t1.jpg">
            <section>Not so far away from the Guruvayoor Temple lies one of the best Thrissur tourist places. An Elephant Sanctuary, the Punnathur Kotta was initially a palace belonging to a local ruler. It was then converted to a house of elephants and now has the highest number captive elephant, about 59 of them.

              This is where these beasts are trained to participate in several festivals. Apart from this, the Punnathur Kotta also has a training centre for Elephant Riders (Mahouts), and temples dedicated to Lord Shiva and Bhagavati.

        <p><h5>Shakthan Thampuran Palace</h5>
          <img src="./images/thri t2.jpg">
          <section>Built after a rather Dutch style architecture, the Shakthan Thampuran Palace is a sight to behold. Finding its name in almost every list of Thrissur tourist places, the Shakthan Thampuran Palace was rebuilt in the place of Vadakkekara Palace in the year 1795 by the then King Ramavarma Thampuram of Cochin.

            In the year 2005, the palace was converted into a museum that now showcases a number of relics and really old antiques. A favourite one amongst several art admirers, the two-storeyed complex has high roofs, thicker than usual walls, and Italian Marble on the floor, making it a place right out of a traveller’s dream.
