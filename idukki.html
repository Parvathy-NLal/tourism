                      Idukki is a district in the Indian state of Kerala.[1] It was constituted on 26 January 1972, by splitting the district of Kottayam into two parts. Its division was earlier headquartered at Kottayam city, but moved to Painavu in June 1976. Idukki district lies amid the Western Ghats of Kerala.

                      Though it is regarded as the second-largest district in the region, it has the lowest population density among the other districts of Kerala,[2] the urban population being higher than the rural. Idukki is rich in forests and also known as the "Spice Garden of Kerala".
                      
                      Till 1998, when Kuttampuzha was added to Ernakulam district, Idukki was the largest district in Kerala.
                      Idukki has an area of 4,358 km2 (1,683 sq mi) and is the second-largest district of Kerala (the largest being Palakkad). Rugged mountains and forests cover about 97 per cent of the total area of the district. The district consists of five taluks: Thodupuzha, Devikulam, Idukki, Udumbanchola, and Peerumedu. The district borders the Kerala districts of Pathanamthitta in the south, Kottayam in the southwest, Ernakulam in the northwest, and Thrissur in the north. Idukki also shares borders with Coimbatore, Dindigul, small parts of Tenkasi, Tiruppur, Theni, and Virudhunagar districts of Tamil Nadu in the east. Idukki is not connected to rail or air networks yet and is accessible only by road. National Highway NH 49 and State highways 13 and 33 passes through the district.[3]Kattappana is the main urban centre in the high ranges of Idukki district, situated about 2,788.71–2,952.76 feet (850.00–900.00 m) above mean sea level and has recently raised to the status of municipality. Kattappana is a CLASS III urban centre. It is the first municipality in high range of Idukki district with the real terraineous touch of Idukki as Thodupuzhamunicipality is situated in low range.

        <p><h5>Arch Dam</h5>
          <img src="./images/idu t2.jpg">
          <section>The Idukki dam is constructed across the Periyar River, in a valley between the Kuravan and Kurathi hills in Kerala. The awe-inspiring, majestic dam, which stands at 167.68 meters (550 ft), is one of the highest arch dams in Asia. The dam, which is one of the Idukki tourist places, constructed by the Kerala government in 1975 and supports 780 MW hydroelectric power station that draws electricity from this dam.

            The sheer magnitude of the structure along with the mountains, verdant vegetation, and 60 sq. km placid lake, which is created by the 3 dams, Idukki dam, Cheruthoni and Kulamavu, captivate the visitors.</section>

          <p><h5>Ilaveezha Poonchira</h5>
            <img src="./images/idu t3.jpg">
          <section>
            “Ila-veezha Poonchira” which means “the pond of flowers where the leaves do not fall” has its roots in Mahabharata. The rains during the monsoon season transmogrify the valley and present an enthralling and hypnotic effect on the visitors. Words fall short to explain the beatitudes of the play of colors on the horizon during the Sunrise and Sunset. Ilaveezha Poonchira is also an ideal destination for trekking.
