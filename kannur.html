                      Kannur (formerly known in English as Cannanore and Portuguese as Cananor) is a city and a Municipal Corporation in North Malabar region, state of Kerala, India. It is the administrative headquarters of the Kannur District and situated 518 kilometres (322 mi) north of the state capital Thiruvananthapuram & 137 kilometres (85 mi) south of the major port city & a commercial hub, Mangalore. During British rule in India, when Kannur was a part of the Malabar District (Madras Presidency), the city was known as Cannanore. Kannur is the largest city of North Malabar region and 6th largest urban agglomeration in Kerala.[2] As of 2011 census, Kannur corporation had population of 232,486.[3]
                      Kannur was an important trading centre in the 12th century, with active business connections with Persia and Arabia. It served as the British military headquarters on India's west coast until 1887. The modern town is referred to as Kannur Town. Kannur, as a district and surrounding areas, were mostly ruled by the famous Kolathiri Rajas (Kings). When the state of Kerala was formed the district took the name Kannur since the administrative offices were established here. Before that, Kannur was under the Chirakkal taluk of Madras state under British rule. When the British dominated this part of the world, they preferred Madras and Cochin as their major stations and Kannur started to lose its old glory. The people of Kannur are still waiting for their old glory to get back and they feel they are being sidelined because the state administration is located the exact opposite side of the state. Part of the original city of Kannur was under Kerala's only Muslim Royalty called the Arakkal and this area is still known as city.

          <p><h5>Ezhimala hill</h5>
            <img src="./images/kann t3.jpg">
          <section>
            Perched at a height of 286 meters, the Ezhimala hill is one of the most visually appealing Kannur tourist places. The hill is a part of an isolated cluster of hills and the vantage point offers bedazzling views of the sheer naked natural splendour around – hills covered in a blanket of green, cotton white clouds covering the clear blue skies, and the beautiful valley underneath. 

            The place also has cultural and historical significance – the place was a battlefield during the Chola-Chera wars. Buddhists consider the place sacred because it is believed that Lord Buddha visited Ezhimala.</section>
