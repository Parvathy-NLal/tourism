                      Kozhikode , also known as Calicut, is an Indian city, second-largest urban agglomeration in the State of Kerala and 19th largest in the country with a population of 2 million according to 2011 census.[9]

                      During classical antiquity and the Middle Ages, Kozhikode was dubbed the City of Spices for its role as the major trading point of Indian spices.[1] A historical city, it was the capital of an independent kingdom ruled by the Samoothiris (Zamorins) in the Middle Ages. According to data compiled by economics research firm Indicus Analytics in 2009 on residences, earnings and investments, Kozhikode ranked as the second best city in India to reside in.[10]
                      The exact origin of the name Kozhikode is uncertain. According to many sources, the name Kozhikode is derived from Koyil-kota (fort), meaning fortified palace.[11] The name also got corrupted into Kolikod, or its anglicized version Calicut.[12]

                          Arab merchants called it Qāliqūṭ (IPA: qˠaːliqˠːuːtˤ).[13]

                          Although the city's official name is Kozhikode, in English it is sometimes known by its anglicised version, Calicut.[14] The word calico, a fine variety of hand-woven cotton cloth that was exported from the port of Kozhikode, is thought to have been derived from Calicut.[15] It is the historical capital of Kerala as the history dates back to 1498 AD when Vasco da Gama landed in Kappad, near Calicut.[16]
                          Kozhikode was the capital of an independent kingdom ruled by the samoothiris (Zamorins) in the Middle Ages and later of the erstwhile Malabar District under British rule. Arab merchants traded with the region as early as 7th century, and Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed at Kozhikode on 20 May 1498, thus opening a trade route between Europe and Malabar. A Portuguese factory and the fort was intact in Kozhikode for short period (1511–1525, until the Fall of Calicut). The English landed in 1615 (constructing a trading post in 1665), followed by the French (1698) and the Dutch (1752).
